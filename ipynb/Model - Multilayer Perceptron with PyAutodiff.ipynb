      "are symmetric around the origin are preferred because they tend to produce\n",

      "At initialization we want the weights to be small enough around the origin\n",
      "so that the activation function operates near its linear regime, where gradients are\n",
      "the largest. Otherwise, the gradient signal used for learning is attenuated by\n",
      "each layer as it is propagated from the classifier towards the inputs.\n",
      "Other desirable properties, especially for deep networks,\n",
      "are to conserve variance of the activation as well as variance of back-propagated gradients from layer to layer.\n",
      "This allows information to flow well upward and downward in the network and\n",
      "reduces discrepancies between layers.\n",

      "Optimization by stochastic gradient descent is very sensitive to the step size or _learning rate_.\n",
      "There is a great deal of literature on how to choose a the learning rate, and how to change it during optimization.\n",
      "The simplest solution is to use a constant rate. Rule of thumb: try\n",
      "several log-spaced values ($10^{-1}, 10^{-2}, \\ldots$) and narrow the\n",

      "$\\mu_0$ is the initial rate (chosen, perhaps, using the grid search\n",
      "technique explained above), $d$ is a so-called \"decrease constant\"\n",
      "which controls the rate at which the learning rate decreases (typically, a\n",
      "smaller positive number, $10^{-3}$ and smaller) and $t$ is the epoch/stage.\n",
