      "# Notational Conventions:\n",
      "\n",
      "This \"notebook\" is essentially a static page describing the notational conventions used throughout the tutorials. At some point it might migrate to a normal webpage, but for now it is here, being served up by IPython itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data Set Notation\n",
      "\n",
      "We label data sets as $\\mathcal{D}$.\n",
      "When the distinction is important, we\n",
      "indicate train, validation, and test sets as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* training data $\\mathcal{D}_{train}$\n",
      "* validation data $\\mathcal{D}_{valid}$\n",
      "* testing data $\\mathcal{D}_{test}$\n",
      "\n",
      "We only ever train on training data, but we measure performance on validation data as a way of choosing the best hyperparameters (model selection).\n",
      "Testing data is only used for estimating generalization after model selection and training.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tutorials mostly deal with classification problems, where each data set\n",
      "$\\mathcal{D}$ is an indexed set of pairs $(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})$. We\n",
      "use superscripts to distinguish training set examples:\n",
      "$x^{(i)} \\in \\mathcal{R}^D$ is thus the i-th training example of dimensionality $D$.\n",
      "Similarly,\n",
      "$y^{(i)} \\in \\{0, ..., L\\}$ is the i-th label assigned to input\n",
      "$x^{(i)}$. It is straightforward to extend these examples to\n",
      "ones where $y^{(i)}$ has other types (e.g. Gaussian for regression,\n",
      "or groups of multinomials for predicting multiple symbols).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Math and Python Conventions\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* Expressions that appear in fixed-width font like `a = b + c` are meant to be\n",
      "  interpreted as Python code, whereas expressions appearing in italics like $a\n",
      "  = b + c$ are meant to be interpreted as math notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In math notation, non-bold lower-case symols denote scalars.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In math notation, bold lower-case symbols like $\\mathbf{x}$ and\n",
      "  $\\mathbf{h}$ denote vectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In math notation, upper-case symbols like $W$ and $V$ typically denote\n",
      "  matrices.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In the LaTeX-powered \"math\" expressions the notation $[a, b]$ denotes\n",
      "  the _continuous inclusive range_ of real-valued numbers $u$ satisfying\n",
      "  $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$.  In contrast, the Python syntax `[a, b]` denotes a\n",
      "  _list_ data structure of two elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Python and NumPy tend to favor C-style \"row-major\" matrices, and we\n",
      "  will follow that convention in the math sections too.\n",
      "  Consequently, vector-matrix products will typically be written with\n",
      "  the vector on the _left_ and the matrix on the _right_, as in\n",
      "  $\\mathbf{h}V$.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Symbols and Acronyms\n",
